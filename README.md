Charity Spending: Determining Likelihood of Success with Machine Learning.

Results: 
## Data Preprocessing
* The features of this model include data relating to the type of application recieved.
* Some data, such as identification factors, were not needed and could be dropped.
* Model targets include the factor of weather or not the funding was successful.
* 
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
* For the optimized model I chose a model known as the feedforward network, having 16 layers, alternating normalization, dense, and dropout layers with decreasing complexity.
* The model achieved over 60% accuracy but did not attain the desired outcome.

Summary: The results of the machine learning model indicate over 60% accuracy in predicting successful outcomes.
